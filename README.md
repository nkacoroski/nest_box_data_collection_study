# Bird Nest Box Data Collection Study
This repository contains work for a study on manual and eNest assisted monitoring of bird nest boxes. Manual monitoring of bird nests can disturb nesting birds, or have an inconsistent and small observation window. Monitoring devices such as eNest, could decrease negative impacts on nest sites while improving data quality by providing continuous observation throughout the nesting season. The experimental design and analysis of this study may be found in the bird nest box study notebook.

## Abstract (1-2 PP, problem, methodology, findings, recommendation)
The purpose of this study is to compare manual and eNest assisted monitoring of bird nest boxes following the NestWatch protocol by The Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Manual data collection consists of identifying nest sites, then visiting the sites every 3-7 days to collect data on nest attempts. At the end of each nest attempt, the volunteer records a nest summary. NestWatch volunteers are trained to minimize their impact on nests, but disturbances may still occur. It can also be difficult for volunteers to visit nests frequently and consistently, which can decrease the quality of data collected and limit volunteer participation. 

Using technology assisted monitoring with eNest, a nest box data collection system, may help mitigate these challenges by reducing number of visits necessary to the nest while increasing the observation window through continuous data collection of nest activity. The eNest device is installed in nests and will operate on battery charge or solar power throughout the entire nesting season. It collects 1-5 still images per day, movement, location (latitude, longitude), and the following environmental metrics: temperature, light, air pressure, humidity. The inclusion of these environmental metrics will expand the breadth of analysis possible for nesting bird behavior. At the end of the breeding season, the eNest device is collected and data is transferred to a computer using a micro SD cord. The data will be uploaded and analyzed using an online dashboard. Once volunteers have identified important nest events, they may submit that information to the NestWatch database.

Thus far eNest has been successfully tested in approximately 50 nest boxes, and was specifically designed to be a non-invasive monitoring device. No research has yet been done, however, to compare eNest assisted to manual monitoring of bird nest sites. This study will provide initial evidence on the viability of eNest assisted monitoring for bird nest boxes, and its integration into the NestWatch community science project.
